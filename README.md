# WeatherGoat

_WeatherGoat_ is my personal Discord bot for reporting weather forecasts and alerts to my server. It uses the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api), is built with Python (Disnake) and Redis, and runs in a Docker container.

## Setup

Copy `config.toml.example` to `config.toml` and fill it out.


## Running

Start `main.py` with a `TOKEN` environment variable containing your bot's token.
