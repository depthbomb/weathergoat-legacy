# weathergoat

A Python script I use to fetch and send alerts from the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) and send them to a Discord channel via webhooks.

## Usage

Rename **weathergoat.ini.example** to **weathergoat.ini** and fill it out, then run **main.py**.
